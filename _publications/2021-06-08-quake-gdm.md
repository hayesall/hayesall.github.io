abstract: >-
  Qualitative influence statements are often provided a priori to guide
  learning; we answer a challenging reverse task and automatically extract them
  from a learned probabilistic model. We apply our Qualitative Knowledge
  Extraction method toward early prediction of gestational diabetes on clinical
  study data. Our empirical results demonstrate that the extracted rules are
  both interpretable and valid.

## Abstract

## Overview

"*Qualitative Influence Statements*" are a concise way to express how variables
interact under all possible values that the variables can take. Previous work
incorporated these as inductive bias to guide learning, but we wanted to
explore whether these statements could be learned directly from data.

<figcaption>We first learned a Bayesian Network for the domain using the PC causal learning algorithm. The variables represent what was known in the first month of pregnancy, and the dependent variable <span style="font-style:italic;">Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</span> (GDM) is diagnosed near the conclusion of a pregnancy at the nine-month mark.</figcaption>
</figure>

Here we incorporated a probabilistic model in the form of a Bayesian Network
and developed a technique we named **QuaKE** (for **Qua**litative **K**nowledge **E**xtraction)
to extract rules like the following:

\\[
\text{BMI}_{\prec}^{M+} \text{GDM}
\\]

This notation is read as "Risk of GDM monotonically increases with BMI," meaning
that higher BMI directly translates into a higher risk of gestational diabetes.

After extracting these statements over all of our variables, we asked how well
they aligned with previous knowledge, and found the precision of our method
was around 91% across five validation folds.
