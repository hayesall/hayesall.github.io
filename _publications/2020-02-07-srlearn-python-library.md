  srlearn is a Python library for learning gradient-boosted statistical
  relational models.
abstract: >-
  We present srlearn, a Python library for boosted statistical relational models.
  We adapt the scikit-learn interface to this setting and provide examples for
  how this can be used to express learning and inference problems.

## `srlearn` overview

`srlearn` has several aims. At a basic level it wraps the state-of-the-art
[BoostSRL package](https://starling.utdallas.edu/software/boostsrl/wiki/)
for learning the structure and parameters of statistical relational models.
At a higher level, it is an ongoing experiment in creating application programming
interfaces (APIs) that blend idea from *logic programming* with what is familiar to
the machine learning and data science communities built around the *Python
programming language*.

This example is presented as *Figure 1* in the paper, and is presently featured
as one of the getting started examples in the `srlearn` documentation:

```python
>>> from srlearn.rdn import BoostedRDN
>>> from srlearn import Background
>>> from srlearn import example_data
>>> bk = Background(
...     modes=example_data.train.modes,
...     use_std_logic_variables=True,
... )
>>> clf = BoostedRDN(
...     background=bk,
...     target='cancer',
... )
>>> clf.fit(example_data.train)
>>> clf.predict_proba(example_data.test)
array([0.88079619, 0.88079619, 0.88079619, 0.3075821 , 0.3075821 ])
>>> clf.classes_
array([1., 1., 1., 0., 0.])
```
