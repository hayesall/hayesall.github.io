We rarely notice that we live inside an invisible layer of liquid heat.
It's obvious that this invisible heat exists–we bundle up in layers of
clothing when there is too little, and we sweat when there is too much–but
these responses are mostly automatic. Having access to 24-hour weather
forecasting helps us plan what to wear, decide to bring an umbrella, or
put on boots in the morning.

**But what if I want to know the temperature exactly where I stand?**
Smartphones have a huge number of built-in sensors, but the best estimate
my phone is capable of uses readings from the nearest weather station.
Weather Underground and similar sites are making local stations more
ubiquitous, but not quite to the level of personalized temperature sensing.

[Rob M. Long](https://robertlongpersonalwebsite.wordpress.com/) proposed a
short study to try and peek into this question with an activity for learning
about different research methods within
[Professor James Clawson's](https://jamesclawson.com/) "*Field Deployments*"
course.

This will describe some of the hands-on portions of the data collection and
analysis. A shorter overview and all code is available on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/hayesall/Informatics-Temperature-Study/).

# Prototyping to collect data

This used a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13975" rel="nofollow">SparkFun RedBoard</a>
for control and a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13314" rel="nofollow">TMP102 Digital Temperature Sensor</a>.
Setup closely followed the [TMP102 Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/tmp102-digital-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide),
with minor differences in the wiring and tweaking the output so it could be
viewed from my laptop.

    created as a <a href="https://github.com/hayesall/Informatics-Temperature-Study/blob/master/docs/svg/schematic.txt">text file</a>
    then rendered with <a href="https://github.com/ivanceras/svgbob">svgbob</a>.

The wire colors are not important, but I listed them in the schematic so they
would be the same as they were in the photos.

# Code and Study Assumptions

TMP102 sensor0(0x48);
int startTime = 0;

void setup() {
	Serial.begin(9600);
	sensor0.begin();
	sensor0.setConversionRate(0);
	Serial.println("Time,TemperatureF");
}

	float temperature;
	sensor0.wakeup();
	temperature = sensor0.readTempF();
	Serial.print(startTime);

	Serial.println(temperature);
	sensor0.sleep();
	delay(2000);
	startTime += 2;

To understand some of the local temperatures in and around the IU Informatics
building, we decided to record temperature at a few different locations and
occasionally record while doing a specific activity.

1. **ProHealth Office**: sitting at my desk
2. **Outside**: walk outside the building, then sit at a bench
3. **A Classroom**: dim the lights and sit
4. **The Breakroom**: put the sensor in the refrigerator
5. **A stroll through the building**

There are a few limitations of this approach. Most obvious is that this
requires carrying a laptop everywhere (which is far from the most user-friendly
approach), and that time is measured as the number of seconds since a
discrete starting point (which would make this difficult to synchronize with
other people or monitoring stations).

# Results

The figure below represents each of the five locations. The *x-axis* shows the
number of seconds after 12:00:02 EST on Monday, April 8, 2019. The *y-axis*
shows the degrees Fahrenheit during each window, and labels the activity.

Horizontal lines were added to show certain time points which may be of
interest, such as when I arrived at an outdoor bench and when I left the bench.

The plot that I found most interesting was the last one, when I walked through
the building. While I walked, I took note of where I was at certain points in
time, such as when I moved from the second floor to the third floor.

On this particular day, I noticed the third floor seemed warmer, and this
appeared to be reflected in the measurements. When I **arrive** on the third floor,
the **temperature begins rising**&mdash;when I **leave** the **temperature
begins falling**.

# Future Work and Further Reading

This window into a personalized temperature profile could provide much richer
information about a person's local environment. Simply reporting the readings
of the nearest weather station may be extremely unreliable for this sort of
task: the nearest station may report high outdoor temperatures, but in reality
a person could be in an air-conditioned office. On the other end of the
spectrum: it could be freezing outside but a person may be washing dishes
in an extremely hot kitchen.

The [**Healthy Cities Lab**](http://healthycities.sice.indiana.edu/sensor/index.html)
at the IU School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering does really
interesting work at the intersection of personalized sensing and environment
monitoring. Check out some of their work if you found this interesting!
