  excerpt: >-
    "Statistical Relational Learning" (SRL) is a
    subfield of artificial intelligence that
    combines logical representations with
    probabilistic reasoning. I've built some tools
    to help users incorporate
    these models into the wider machine learning
    ecosystem, or apply them to new applications.

    Occasionally one of my projects has a need that
    seems like it could be helpful elsewhere. So I extract
    the code into a more-general utility.

  excerpt: >-
    Things I built while working on a course or
    learning something new. Generally I built these to
    "learn lessons" rather than "develop for long-term support,"
    so the quality has high variance.
