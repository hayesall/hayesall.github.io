    Graded assignments and exams, prepared and verified automata examples prior to lectures, and provided additional support to students outside of class.

**Indiana University, Bloomington**  
Department of Informatics and Computer Science

- **Undergraduate Researcher, STARAI Lab** (July 2017 &mdash; July 2018)
  - Explored methods combining Natural Language Processing and Statistical Relational Learning for information extraction on SEC Form S-1 Documents.
  - Facilitated the public release of the lab's source code onto GitHub, distributed as [BoostSRL](https://github.com/starling-lab/BoostSRL/). Maintained the BoostSRL wiki and tutorials.

- **Undergraduate Researcher, ProHealth Research Experience for Undergraduates** (May 2016 &mdash; August 2016)  
  - Built on research which previously inferred adverse side-effects of drugs based on text data mined from the web. Our work focused on predicting drug-drug interactions from data mined from OpenFDA, PubMed, and a variety of Blogs.

- **Camp Counselor, SICE Summer Camp** (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017)  
  - Led sessions on intermediate Python programming, Scratch, Raspberry Pi, information security, and data analytics.  
  - Introduced high school students to Indiana University's campus, navigated them between sessions where they learned about computer science and informatics.
