## Experience

**Indiana University, Bloomington**  
Luddy School of Informatics, Computer Science, and Engineering

- **Instructor of Record** &mdash; (August 2024 &mdash; **Present**)

  - Fall 2024 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure II* &ndash; INFO-I 211  
    Taught from the book Erika and I wrote over the summer, adapting it from an asynchronous online course to a synchronous in-person course.

- **Associate Instructor** &mdash; (January 2023 &mdash; July 2024)

  - Summer 2024 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure II* &ndash; INFO-I 211 (asynchronous, online)  
    *Supervisor*: Erika Lee  
    Piloted GitHub Actions to finish putting the "auto" in autograding, and wrote the first draft of a book with Erika Lee for teaching an asynchronous web app development course.
  - Spring 2024 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure II* &ndash; INFO-I 211  
    *Supervisor*: Matt Hottell  
    Large cohort (200+ students) stress-tested previous workflows. Worked on autograding infrastructure: enough to orchestrate copies of GitHub repos, automatically test them, or bootstrap a Flask application.
  - Fall 2023 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure II* &ndash; INFO-I 211  
    *Supervisor*: Matt Hottell  
    Took a role as a course manager, writer, and grading. The key objective was to minimize the number of people touching the gradebook.
  - Summer 2023 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure II* &ndash; INFO-I 211  
    *Supervisor*: Matt Hottell  
    Moved all course assignments into GitHub repositories, and introduced "unit testing" to motivate how we know when programs meet expectations.
  - Summer 2023 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure I* &ndash; INFO-I 210  
    *Supervisor*: Shabnam Kavousian  
    Worked with Shabnam Kavousian to develop and teach an alternate "intro Python programming" curriculum with permission from the department chair and director of undergraduate studies. Collected data and wrote an internal pilot study, finding that the students who took the alternate I210 with Shabnam and I tended to outperform their peers in future classes.
  - Spring 2023 &ndash; *Information Infrastructure II* &ndash; INFO-I 211  
    *Supervisor*: Matt Hottell and Erika Lee  
    Led two weekly lab sessions, hosted evening help sessions, guided students during lectures, and learned how the course worked.

- **Research Assistant** &mdash; *Computer Vision Lab* (January 2022 &mdash; January 2023)

  - Investigated explainability in time series problems
  - Implemented a Bayesian network (BN) explainability technique as a Python package targeting the pomegranate library
  - Extended the technique toward handling time series problems where the sequence is represented by a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)

- **Graduate Mentor - Research Experience for Undergraduates** &mdash; *ProHealth Lab* (May 2022 &mdash; July 2022)

  - Mentored for a project analyzing smartwatch data alongside clinical data
  - Extended prior work for infrastructure development in the Hoosier Moms Cohort
  - Wrote course material for exploratory data analysis, scientific programming, and git

- **Research Assistant** &ndash; *ProHealth Lab* &ndash; *Precision Health Initiative* (January 2019 &mdash; December 2021)

  - Secondary analysis on incidence of gestational diabetes
    - Developed tools for data cleaning and pre-processing for creating reproducible data partitions: [numom2b.org](http://numom2b.org).
    - Solved the binary class imbalance problem (imbalance of 1 to 32).
    - Reduced features (original feature space ~7000 variables)
    - Explained predictions for a clinical decision support setting.
  - Infrastructure development for Hoosier Moms Cohort
    - Implemented caching to work with snapshots of the database
    - Decreased analysis time from >72 hours to <5 minutes
    - Prototyped a dashboard for exploratory visualization ([hmc-dashboard](https://github.com/iuprohealth/hmc-dashboard))

**CareBand Inc.**  
222 West Merchandise Mart Plaza #1230, Chicago, IL

- **Developer and Machine Learning Research Consultant** (February 2020 &mdash; August 2020)

  - Implemented solutions for indoor location tracking.
  - Developed models to analyze trends in user behavior.

**The University of Texas at Dallas**  
Department of Computer Science, Richardson, TX

- **Teaching Assistant** (August 2018 &mdash; December 2018)

  - Fall 2018 &ndash; *Automata Theory* &ndash; CS 4384.001  
    Led two lectures on finite automata minimization. Graded assignments and exams, prepared and verified automata examples prior to lectures, and held four hours of office hours per week to answer questions.

- **Research Assistant** &ndash; *StARLinG Lab* (May 2018 &mdash; August 2018)

    - Extended the lab's open source tool for converting raw text into relational facts. Rewrote the software so it could be used as a command-line tool or as an imported Python package. Released the software as [rnlp](https://pypi.org/project/rnlp/).
    - Documented, unit tested, and ensured correctness of a Python port of [Relational Functional Gradient Boosting (rfgb)](https://pypi.org/project/rfgb/).

- **Teaching Assistant** (August 2017 &mdash; May 2018)  

  - Spring 2018 &ndash; *C Programming in a UNIX Environment* &ndash; CS 3377.501  
    Provided feedback on C++ programming assignments and bash scripts in terms of documentation, style, and functionality of code.
  - Fall 2017 &ndash; *Automata Theory* &ndash; CS 4384.001  
    Graded assignments and exams, prepared and verified automata examples prior to lectures, and provided additional support to students outside of class.

**Indiana University, Bloomington**

- **Undergraduate Researcher, ProHealth Research Experience for Undergraduates** (May 2016 &mdash; August 2016)  
  - Built on research which previously inferred adverse side-effects of drugs based on text data mined from the web. Our work focused on predicting drug-drug interactions from data mined from OpenFDA, PubMed, and a variety of Blogs.

- **Camp Counselor, SICE Summer Camp** (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017)  
  - Led sessions on intermediate Python programming, Scratch, Raspberry Pi, information security, and data analytics.  
  - Introduced high school students to Indiana University's campus, navigated them between sessions where they learned about computer science and informatics.
